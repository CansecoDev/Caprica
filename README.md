# Caprica
An attempt to write a compiler for the Papyrus scripting language used by the Creation Engine. This was embarked upon because I was impatient and didn't want to wait for the Creation Kit to be released. Once mature, it also has the possibility of furthering the development of the language, and solving various annoyances in the official implementation.

Please note that this is developed against MSVC 2015, so other compilers may not work, and earlier versions of MSVC almost certainly won't due to C++11 support.
